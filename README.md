# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide a way to display the collected data of UFO sightings across the United States, with a visual that could be filtered across a multitude of criteria including date, city, state, country, and shape.

When entering the page, the page displays the picture above. Scrolling through, you can see the complete unfilterd data as displayed below:

On the left side of the page, you will see the input boxes allowing the ability to input text within the filters.

The script will detect a change in the box after typing and will then filter the data and display the row.

## Summary

A drawback of this website is that because the filters are input boxes, a user must be familiar with what is already in the table in order to return a results. Having drop down menus for selections that have set criteria such as State and City would make the page more approachable. 

Upon future development , I suggest cleaning the data provided first to make it more consistent and user friendly.
